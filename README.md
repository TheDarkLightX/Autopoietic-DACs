Autopoietic-DACs
================

Self-replicating-self-healing-self-designing-self-sustaining decentralized autonomous communities. These are DACs with artificial intelligence at the core which leverages the incentive driven design, gamification, and the profit motive to encourage human beings to continuously build, design, and maintain the system. The artificial intelligence at the core of the system is fed resources which includes storage, computation, bandwidth, human and machine services. It uses these resources to create itself from a seed to a fully operational DAC.
